# flip-clock

Even though there are a few of good sites showing a modern flip clock out there, like https://flipclock.online/ and https://flipclocker.com/, I still want to build one by my own and no need to rely on others' hosting it. With the help of ChatGPT, it only costs me about 15 minutes from the scratch to deployment on Github Page. Easy!

Time Flies!
